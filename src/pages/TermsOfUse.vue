      <h3>7. No Personal And/Or Financial Advice</h3>
        <p>Cementum is not your advisor, broker, or intermediary, and has no fiduciary relationship or obligation to you in connection with any trades or other activities or decisions affected by you using Cementum Services. Cementum does not provide personal advice in relation to our products and services. No communication or information provided to you by Cementum is intended as, or shall be construed as, investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, recommendation to transact in any investment or solicitation to engage in any investment activity.</p>
        <p>All trades are executed automatically using smart contract technology, based on the parameters of your order instructions, and you are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy or related transaction is appropriate for you according to your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance, and you shall be solely responsible for any loss or liability therefrom. You have to make sure that the content of the smart contract meets your goals and interests, and you fully understand its content.</p>
        <p>We do not monitor whether your use of Cementum Services is consistent with your financial goals and objectives. It is up to you to assess whether your financial resources are adequate for your financial activity with us, and to your risk appetite in the products and services you use.</p>
        <p>Before making the decision to buy, sell or hold any Digital Asset, you should conduct your own due diligence and/or consult your financial advisors prior to making any investment decision. Cementum will not be held responsible for the decisions you make to buy, sell, or hold Digital Asset based on the information provided by Cementum.</p>
      <h3>8. No Tax, Regulatory or Legal Advice</h3>
        <p>The taxation of Digital Assets is uncertain, and you are responsible for determining what taxes you might be liable to, and how they apply, when transacting through the Cementum Services. It is your responsibility to report and pay any taxes from transacting on Cementum Services (if such exist), and you acknowledge that Cementum does not provide legal or tax status or obligations relative to these transactions.</p>
        <p>If you have any doubts about your tax status or obligations when using Cementum Services, or with respect to the Digital Assets held on your wallets, you may wish to seek independent advice. You are encouraged to seek professional and personal tax advice regarding any digital asset transaction.</p>
      <h3>9. Market Risks</h3>
        <p>Digital Asset trading is subject to high risk and price volatility. Changes in value may be significant and may occur rapidly and without warning. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. The value of an investment and any returns can go up or down, and you may not get back the amount you invested.</p>
        <p>By accepting these Terms you acknowledge that you are entering into any investment or trade on your own accord having done your own due diligence.</p>

You should be aware that certain types of products might carry greater risks and may not be easily understood by non-experts. If you have doubts about using any of the services offered by Cementum, you should either seek advice from an independent financial advisor or abstain from partaking.</p>
      <h3>10. Liquidity Risks</h3>
        <p>Digital Assets may have limited liquidity which may make it difficult or impossible for you to sell or exit a position when you wish to do so. This may occur at any time, including at times of rapid price movements. We encourage you to monitor the liquidity of every Digital Asset prior to making any trade.</p>
      <h3>11. Fees & Charges</h3>
        <p>Fees and charges are subject to the page display on the day. Cementum may, at its sole discretion, update the fees & charges from time to time. Such changes will be communicated to you accordingly. Be aware of all costs and charges that apply to you because such costs and charges will affect the gains you generate from using Cementum Services.</p>
      <h3>12. Impermanent Loss</h3>
        <p>Please be aware and well educated on the consequences of impermanent loss before adding liquidity to any of the liquidity pools available on Cementum. Pools that contain assets that remain in a relatively small price range will be less exposed to impermanent loss. Stable coins or different wrapped versions of a coin, for example, will stay in a relatively contained price range. In this case, there’s a smaller risk of impermanent loss for liquidity providers (LPs). Impermanent loss is one of the fundamental concepts that anyone who wants to provide liquidity to AMMs should understand.</p>
      <h3>13. Availability Risks</h3>
        <p>Cementum does not guarantee that Cementum Services will be available at any particular time or that Cementum Services will not be subject to unplanned service outages or network congestion. It may not be possible to buy, sell, stake/unstake or add tokens to liquidity pools when you wish to do so.</p>

      <h3>14. Release of Claims</h3>
      <p>You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access and use of the services. You further expressly waive and release us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your use of the services.</p>
      <h3>15. Indemnity</h3>
      <p>You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify Cementum from and against all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from:</p>
      <ul>
